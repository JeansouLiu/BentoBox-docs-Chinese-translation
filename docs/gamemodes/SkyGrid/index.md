# SkyGrid

**SkyGrid** is a map filled with floating blocks placed on a four block grid. So every fourth block in every direction is an actual block, and everything else is air.  The creator of the original SkyBlick, SethBling, released SkyGrid in 2012 and it has become one of the most popular Minecraft maps to play in.

There are goals and techniques to playing (and surviving) in SkyGrid and there is no shortage of online help, tips and ways to make this game very fun!
